### ✅ Key Insights
- **Wait Times Are Consistent**  
  Over 18 months, the average wait time remained between **34–36 minutes**, far below the U.S. average of **145 minutes**.

- **Patient Satisfaction Stays Steady**  
  Scores ranged from **4.63 to 5.33**, showing minimal fluctuation.  
  ➡️ Longer waits = Lower satisfaction.

- **Mornings Are the Busiest**  
  The longest waits occur before noon, likely because patients:  
  - Visit before work or school  
  - Respond to early medical issues  
  - Assume mornings are less crowded  

- **Top Referral Sources**  
  - *General Practice* leads in referrals  
  - *Orthopedics* follows with about half as many  

- **Diversity & Disparities**  
  The hospital serves a diverse population. Given relatively low satisfaction scores, further research could explore links between race and patient experience, as studies show systemic disparities in care.
