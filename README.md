## ✅ Key Insights

### Wait Times Are Consistent
Over 18 months, the average wait time remained between **34–36 minutes**, far below the U.S. average of 145 minutes.

### Patient Satisfaction Stays Steady
Scores ranged from **4.63 to 5.33**, showing minimal fluctuation. While no official U.S. benchmark exists, the data suggests:  
*Longer waits = Lower satisfaction.*

### Mornings Are the Busiest
The longest waits occur **before noon**, likely because patients:  
- Visit before work or school  
- Respond to early medical issues  
- Assume mornings are less crowded  

### Top Referral Sources
- **General Practice** leads in referrals  
- **Orthopedics** follows with half as many  

*These insights can guide staffing and resource planning.*

### Diversity & Disparities
The hospital serves a diverse patient population. Given relatively low satisfaction scores, further research could explore links between **race and patient experience**, as studies show systemic disparities in care.
