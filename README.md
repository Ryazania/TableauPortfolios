Project 1 - Emergency Room #RWFD
📊 Key Insights from the Dashboard

✅ Wait Times Are Consistent
Over 18 months, the average wait time stayed between 34–36 minutes, which is far below the U.S. average of 145 minutes.

✅ Patient Satisfaction Stays Steady
Satisfaction scores ranged from 4.63 to 5.33, showing minimal fluctuation. While no official U.S. benchmark was found, the data suggests a clear trend: longer waits = lower satisfaction.

✅ Mornings Are the Busiest
The longest waits happen before noon—likely because patients visit before work or school, respond to early medical issues, or assume mornings are less busy.

✅ Top Referral Sources

General Practice leads in referrals.

Orthopedics comes second with about half as many.
This insight can help inform staffing and resource planning.

✅ Diversity & Disparities
The hospital serves a diverse patient population. Given the relatively low satisfaction scores, further research should explore the link between race and patient experience, as studies show systemic disparities in care.

🔍 Why This Project Matters

This dashboard not only highlights operational trends in emergency care but also demonstrates technical Tableau skills, including interactive visualizations and data-driven storytelling.

Do you want me to add a visual structure like emojis, bullet styles, or a section for screenshots and GIF previews to make it look more appealing for GitHub? Or should I also include a short tagline and project description for the top of the README?
