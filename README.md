✅ Key Insights from the Dashboard
✔ Wait Times Are Consistent

Over 18 months, the average wait time stayed between 34–36 minutes, far below the U.S. average of 145 minutes.

✔ Patient Satisfaction Stays Steady

Scores ranged from 4.63 to 5.33, showing minimal fluctuation. While no official U.S. benchmark was found, the data suggests:
Longer waits = Lower satisfaction.

✔ Mornings Are the Busiest

The longest waits happen before noon, likely because:

Patients visit before work or school

Respond to early medical issues

Assume mornings are less crowded

✔ Top Referral Sources

General Practice leads in referrals

Orthopedics follows with half as many
This insight can guide staffing and resource planning.

✔ Diversity & Disparities

The hospital serves a diverse patient population. Given relatively low satisfaction scores, further research could explore links between race and patient experience, as studies show systemic disparities in care.
